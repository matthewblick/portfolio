    <p class="heading">Captured near Enville, in rural Staffordshire, my goal was to create an image of an environment lost in the darkness of night; a world unseen with the naked&nbsp;eye.</p>

        <p class="annotations">With my equipment set up to the side of a country lane, I procceeded to record multiple exposures lasting as long as 90 seconds. As the light information was being captured, I wandered around the foreground using a white LED tourch to light up the scene, allowing the colours lost in darkness to record to the image. The orange glow behind the hedge is given off from the lights of Birmingham, about 25km away. Once I had worked my way up to the sky, I merely left the stars to gradually burn their presence clear into the image, providing a pretty remarkable&nbsp;result.</p>
